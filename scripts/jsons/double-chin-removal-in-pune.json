      "content": "A double chin, medically known as submental fat, is the extra layer of fat and loose skin that forms beneath the chin. It may result from weight gain, genetics, ageing, or skin laxity.\n\nWhile harmless, a double chin can affect facial profile, jawline definition, and confidence. Even with diet and exercise, this stubborn pocket of fat is often hard to lose.\n\nAt The Skin Firm, Pune, we offer safe and effective non-surgical double chin removal treatments to sculpt, tighten, and define your jawline - helping you look slimmer and more youthful without surgery."
