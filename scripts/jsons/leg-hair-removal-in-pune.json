          "question": "Q. Is the Laser Leg Hair Removal treatment safe for all skin types?",
          "answer": "Yes. At The Skin Firm, we use advanced FDA-approved lasers that are safe and effective across different skin tones and hair types, with settings customised by our dermatologist."
        },
        {
          "question": "Q. Does laser leg hair removal hurt?",
          "answer": "The procedure is generally well-tolerated. Most patients describe it as a mild snapping sensation. Cooling gels and devices are used to keep you comfortable."
        },
        {
          "question": "Q. How many sessions of leg hair removal will I need?",
          "answer": "Typically, 6–8 sessions spaced 4–6 weeks apart are required for best results, though this may vary depending on your hair density, skin type, and hormonal factors."

        {
          "question": "Q. Can I shave between sessions?",
          "answer": "Yes, shaving is safe and even recommended between laser sessions. Avoid waxing, threading, or plucking, as these remove the hair follicle the laser needs to target."
        },
        {
          "question": "Q. Are there any side effects of Leg Hair Removal Treatment?",
          "answer": "Mild redness or sensitivity may occur temporarily but usually subsides within a few hours. Our dermatologist ensures the procedure is performed safely to minimise risks like burns or pigmentation."
