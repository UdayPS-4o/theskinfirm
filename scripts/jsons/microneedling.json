      "title": "What Is Microneedling?",
      "content": "Microneedling is a minimally invasive skin treatment that uses fine, medical-grade needles to create controlled micro-injuries in the skin. These stimulate the body’s natural healing response, boosting collagen and elastin production the key proteins responsible for smooth, firm, youthful-looking skin.\n\nIt is one of the most trusted dermatologist-recommended treatments worldwide for:\n\n- Acne scars & stretch marks\n- Enlarged pores\n- Fine lines & wrinkles\n- Uneven skin tone\n- Dull or rough skin texture\n\nAt The Skin Firm, we often pair microneedling with microdermabrasion a gentle exfoliation technique that polishes away dead cells from the surface. While microneedling works from within, microdermabrasion enhances results by refining the outermost skin layer for a complete rejuvenation."
