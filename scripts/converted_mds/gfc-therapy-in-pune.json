      "title": "What Is GFC Therapy?",
      "content": "GFC Therapy (Growth Factor Concentrate Therapy) is an advanced, autologous (your own blood-derived) treatment that harnesses the power of natural growth factors to stimulate healing, regeneration, and rejuvenation.\n\nA small amount of your blood is processed in a special kit to extract a highly concentrated solution of platelet-derived growth factors. These growth factors are then injected into the scalp (for hair regrowth) or skin (for scars, wrinkles, or dullness).\n\nCompared to traditional PRP, **GFC** **Therapy** **in** **Pune** is more refined, more concentrated, and delivers better, faster results - with minimal discomfort and zero risk of allergies.\n\nAt The Skin Firm, Pune, we offer GFC Therapy for both hair restoration and skin rejuvenation, using advanced kits under dermatologist supervision."
