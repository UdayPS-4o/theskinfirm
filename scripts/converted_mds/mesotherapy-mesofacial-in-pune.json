      "content": "Mesotherapy, also called MesoFacial when used for the face, is a minimally invasive skin rejuvenation treatment that delivers a customised blend of vitamins, antioxidants, peptides, and hyaluronic acid directly into the middle layer of the skin (mesoderm).\n\nUnlike topical skincare, which only works on the surface, mesotherapy nourishes skin cells from within stimulating collagen, improving circulation, and enhancing hydration.\n\nAt The Skin Firm, we offer both classic mesotherapy injections and non-invasive MesoFacial protocols, depending on your comfort level and goals. Both treatments leave your skin looking fresher, smoother, and more radiant."
