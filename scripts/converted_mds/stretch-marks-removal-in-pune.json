      "content": "Stretch marks, medically known as striae, are long, narrow streaks that develop when the skin stretches too quickly and the collagen and elastin fibers beneath the surface tear. They often start off as red, purple or pink lines and later fade into white or silvery marks.\n\nThey are commonly found on the abdomen, thighs, hips, arms, breasts, and back— appearing after pregnancy, puberty, sudden weight changes, or heavy workouts.\n\nWhile harmless, they can affect self-confidence especially when wearing sleeveless clothes, swimwear, or fitted outfits.\n\nAt The Skin Firm, Pune, we offer advanced stretch marks removal treatments that safely reduce their appearance, restore smoother skin, and help you feel confident again."
