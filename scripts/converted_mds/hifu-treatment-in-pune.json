      "title": "What Is HIFU?",
      "content": "HIFU, or High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound, is a revolutionary non-invasive anti-ageing treatment that uses ultrasound energy to stimulate collagen production in the deeper layers of the skin.\n\nUnlike facials or creams that work only on the surface, HIFU penetrates below the skin to lift, tighten, and improve elasticity all without surgery, needles, or significant downtime.\n\nIt’s often called a “lunchtime facelift” because it delivers visible lifting and tightening with minimal discomfort and quick recovery. At The Skin Firm, we customise every HIFU session to target sagging, fine lines, double chin, or jawline definition, giving you a refreshed and youthful look."
