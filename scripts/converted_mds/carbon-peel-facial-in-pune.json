      "content": "The **Carbon** **Peel** **Facial**, also known as the **Carbon** **Laser** **Facial** or **Hollywood** **Peel**, is a non-invasive laser treatment designed to deeply cleanse pores, reduce oiliness, fade pigmentation, and leave the skin instantly refreshed.\n\nThe procedure involves applying a thin layer of medical-grade liquid carbon to the skin, which penetrates deep into the pores. When activated with a laser, the carbon particles absorb oil, dirt, and dead skin cells - providing a powerful **pore** **cleansing** **facial** while stimulating collagen production.\n\nAt The Skin Firm, NIBM, Pune we use advanced **carbon** **peel** **technology** **for** **acne** **&** **pigmentation** **treatment**, helping patients achieve clearer, brighter, and younger-looking skin - with zero downtime."
