      "content": "Tattoo removal is a specialised treatment that uses laser technology to break down tattoo pigments in the skin. Over multiple sessions, the body naturally eliminates these tiny ink particles, gradually fading the tattoo.\n\nAt The Skin Firm, we use USFDA-approved Q-switched and Pico laser technology that specifically targets ink pigments without harming the surrounding skin. Whether it’s a name, design, or professional tattoo you no longer want, our treatments help restore clear skin safely and effectively."
