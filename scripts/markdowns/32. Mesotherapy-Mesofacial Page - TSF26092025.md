**What Is Mesotherapy / MesoFacial?**

Mesotherapy, also called MesoFacial when used for the face, is a minimally invasive skin rejuvenation treatment that delivers a customised blend of vitamins, antioxidants, peptides, and hyaluronic acid directly into the middle layer of the skin (mesoderm).

Unlike topical skincare, which only works on the surface, mesotherapy nourishes skin cells from within stimulating collagen, improving circulation, and enhancing hydration.

At The Skin Firm, we offer both classic mesotherapy injections and non-invasive MesoFacial protocols, depending on your comfort level and goals. Both treatments leave your skin looking fresher, smoother, and more radiant.

**Signs & Concerns Mesotherapy Can Treat**

- Dull, tired-looking skin
- Fine lines and early wrinkles
- Uneven tone and pigmentation
- Dehydration and loss of glow
- Acne scars or post-acne marks
- Mild sagging or reduced elasticity
- Stress- and pollution-damaged skin

**Why Choose Mesotherapy at The Skin Firm?**

Sometimes facials or creams are not enough to repair and rejuvenate the skin. If your skin feels tired, dull, or prematurely aged, mesotherapy offers a deeper, medical-grade solution.

At The Skin Firm, mesotherapy is performed under the care of Skin Specialist Dr. Karishma Singh, ensuring your treatment is safe, personalised, and effective. With high-quality serums, advanced delivery systems, and customised protocols, we help you achieve long-lasting glow and skin repair.

**How Our Mesotherapy / MesoFacial Works**

**Step 1 - Consultation & Skin Assessment**  
We analyse your skin needs and decide between injection-based mesotherapy or a gentler MesoFacial.

**Step 2 - Skin Preparation**  
Cleansing and optional numbing cream to ensure comfort.

**Step 3 - Mesotherapy Treatment**  
Micro-injections deliver a customised mix of vitamins, hyaluronic acid, and antioxidants into the skin. For MesoFacial, non-invasive infusion techniques are used.

**Step 4 - Hydration & Soothing**  
Cooling serums and masks are applied to calm the skin and enhance results.

**Step 5 - Aftercare & Maintenance**  
We provide skincare and routine advice to maintain results at home.
