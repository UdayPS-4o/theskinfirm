**How The Diode Laser Hair Removal Treatment Works**

**Step 1: Consultation & Skin/Hair Assessment**  
We evaluate skin tone, hair density, hair colour, sensitivity, lifestyle, and body zones to treat.

**Step 2: Personalized Treatment Plan**  
We define which body zones you want covered (full body vs selected areas), estimate number of sessions, and set laser parameters.

**Step 3: The Procedure**  
Diode laser pulses are applied across the selected zones. Cooling, protective eyewear, etc. Sessions take longer depending on area size (arms + legs + back etc.), but are managed in parts if needed.

**Step 4: Post-Procedure Care & Follow-Up**  
Soothing measures applied, sun protection, avoidance of friction, maintenance schedule and follow-ups until results begin to stabilise and regrowth is minimal.
