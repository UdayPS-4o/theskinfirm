**What** **Is** **Double** **Chin** **Removal?**

A double chin, medically known as submental fat, is the extra layer of
fat and loose skin that forms beneath the chin. It may result from
weight gain, genetics, ageing, or skin laxity.

While harmless, a double chin can affect facial profile, jawline
definition, and confidence. Even with diet and exercise, this stubborn
pocket of fat is often hard to lose.

At The Skin Firm, Pune, we offer safe and effective non-surgical double
chin removal treatments to sculpt, tighten, and define your jawline -
helping you look slimmer and more youthful without surgery.

**Signs** **&** **Concerns** **of** **Double** **Chin**

> Extra fat under the chin
>
> Sagging or loose skin in the neck area
>
> Blurred jawline definition
>
> Heavier or older appearance despite healthy weight
>
> Poor facial profile in photos
>
> Genetic predisposition to chin fullness
