**What Is HIFU?**

HIFU, or High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound, is a revolutionary non-invasive anti-ageing treatment that uses ultrasound energy to stimulate collagen production in the deeper layers of the skin.

Unlike facials or creams that work only on the surface, HIFU penetrates below the skin to lift, tighten, and improve elasticity all without surgery, needles, or significant downtime.

It’s often called a “lunchtime facelift” because it delivers visible lifting and tightening with minimal discomfort and quick recovery. At The Skin Firm, we customise every HIFU session to target sagging, fine lines, double chin, or jawline definition, giving you a refreshed and youthful look.

**Signs & Concerns HIFU Can Treat**

- Sagging skin on face, neck, or jawline
- Drooping eyebrows or eyelids
- Double chin or undefined jawline
- Fine lines and wrinkles
- Mild to moderate skin laxity
- Uneven skin tone and texture
- Early signs of ageing (30s-50s)

**Why Choose HIFU at The Skin Firm?**

As we age, collagen levels naturally decline, leading to sagging and wrinkles. If you’re not ready for surgery but want visible lifting and tightening, HIFU is an excellent choice.

At The Skin Firm, treatments are supervised by Skin Specialist Dr. Karishma Singh, ensuring safety, comfort, and natural-looking results. With medical-grade HIFU technology and personalised treatment mapping, we help you achieve firmer, more youthful skin without going under the knife.

**How Our HIFU Treatment Works**

**Step 1 - Consultation & Skin Assessment**  
We evaluate your skin’s laxity, areas of concern, and suitability for HIFU.

**Step 2 - Cleansing & Marking**  
Skin is cleansed, and treatment areas are mapped for precision.

**Step 3 - Ultrasound Energy Delivery**  
Focused ultrasound waves penetrate deep into the skin layers, stimulating collagen and tightening tissue.

**Step 4 - Cooling & Soothing**  
A soothing gel is applied to calm the skin.

**Step 5 - Aftercare & Guidance**  
We provide skincare and lifestyle advice to maintain results.
