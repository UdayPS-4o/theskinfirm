**What Is Tattoo Removal?**

Tattoo removal is a specialised treatment that uses laser technology to break down tattoo pigments in the skin. Over multiple sessions, the body naturally eliminates these tiny ink particles, gradually fading the tattoo.

At The Skin Firm, we use USFDA-approved Q-switched and Pico laser technology that specifically targets ink pigments without harming the surrounding skin. Whether it’s a name, design, or professional tattoo you no longer want, our treatments help restore clear skin safely and effectively.

**Signs & Concerns Tattoo Removal Can Address**

- Unwanted names or symbols
- Tattoos that no longer match your lifestyle or preferences
- Faded or poorly done tattoos
- Tattoo mistakes from earlier years
- Profession or wedding-related tattoo clearance
- Allergic reactions or irritation from tattoo pigments

**Why Choose Tattoo Removal at The Skin Firm?**

Tattoos can feel permanent, but thanks to modern laser technology, they no longer have to be. At The Skin Firm, we understand that tattoo regret is real and removing it safely is just as important as getting it.

Under the supervision of Skin Specialist Dr. Karishma Singh, every tattoo removal plan is customised based on tattoo size, colour, depth, and skin type. Using medical-grade technology and safety-first protocols, we deliver visible results while minimising discomfort and downtime.

**How Our Tattoo Removal Works**

**Step 1 - Consultation & Skin Analysis**  
We assess the tattoo’s age, colour, size, and your skin type to determine the treatment plan.

**Step 2 - Preparation**  
The area is cleaned, and numbing cream may be applied for comfort.

**Step 3 - Laser Tattoo Removal**  
Advanced laser beams target tattoo pigments, breaking them into tiny fragments that the body clears naturally.

**Step 4 - Cooling & Soothing**  
Post-laser, cooling is applied to reduce redness or swelling.

**Step 5 - Aftercare Guidance**  
We provide personalised skincare advice to support healing and fading between sessions.
