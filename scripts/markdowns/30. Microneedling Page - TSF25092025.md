**What Is Microneedling?**

Microneedling is a minimally invasive skin treatment that uses fine, medical-grade needles to create controlled micro-injuries in the skin. These stimulate the body’s natural healing response, boosting collagen and elastin production the key proteins responsible for smooth, firm, youthful-looking skin.

It is one of the most trusted dermatologist-recommended treatments worldwide for:

- Acne scars & stretch marks
- Enlarged pores
- Fine lines & wrinkles
- Uneven skin tone
- Dull or rough skin texture

At The Skin Firm, we often pair microneedling with microdermabrasion a gentle exfoliation technique that polishes away dead cells from the surface. While microneedling works from within, microdermabrasion enhances results by refining the outermost skin layer for a complete rejuvenation.

**Signs & Concerns Microneedling Can Treat**

- Acne scars and pitted scars
- Stretch marks on body areas  
    <br/>
- Large or open pores
- Fine lines and early ageing signs
- Uneven tone and pigmentation
- Rough, dull, or tired-looking skin
- Mild sagging or loss of firmness

**Why Choose Microneedling at The Skin Firm?**

Struggling with scars, dullness, or ageing skin? We understand how these concerns can affect your confidence. Many patients try endless creams or salon facials with little success, but medical-grade treatments like microneedling deliver real, long-lasting improvements.

At The Skin Firm, every microneedling session is carefully customised by Skin Specialist Dr. Karishma Singh, ensuring both safety and visible results. With advanced technology, sterile techniques, and evidence-based protocols, we help you achieve smoother, firmer, glowing skin without aggressive downtime.

**How Our Microneedling & Microdermabrasion Treatment Works**

**Step 1 - Consultation & Skin Assessment**  
We analyse your skin condition, concerns, and suitability for microneedling or microdermabrasion.

**Step 2 - Skin Prep & Cleansing**  
The area is cleaned and numbing cream may be applied for comfort.

**Step 3 - Microneedling Treatment**  
A dermapen or microneedling device creates controlled micro-channels, stimulating collagen production and improving absorption of active serums.

**Step 4 - Optional Microdermabrasion**  
For enhanced results, we perform microdermabrasion either before or after microneedling to gently exfoliate and polish the skin surface.

**Step 5 - Soothing & Hydration**  
Calming serums, masks, and SPF are applied to protect and restore the skin barrier.

**Step 6 - Aftercare & Maintenance**  
We guide you with dermatologist-approved skincare and maintenance options.
