**What** **Is** **HydraFacial?**

HydraFacial is a non-invasive skin rejuvenation treatment that combines
deep cleansing, exfoliation, extraction, hydration, and antioxidant
infusion all in one session.

Unlike regular facials, HydraFacial uses a patented vortex technology
to:

> Remove dirt, oil, and impurities
>
> Infuse skin with hydrating serums
>
> Deliver immediate radiance with long-lasting results

Safe for all skin types, it’s the go-to treatment for red-carpet-ready
glow.
