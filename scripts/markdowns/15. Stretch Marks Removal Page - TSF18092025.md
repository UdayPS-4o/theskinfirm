**What** **Are** **Stretch** **Marks?**

Stretch marks, medically known as striae, are long, narrow streaks that
develop when the skin stretches too quickly and the collagen and elastin
fibers beneath the surface tear. They often start off as red, purple or
pink lines and later fade into white or silvery marks.

They are commonly found on the abdomen, thighs, hips, arms, breasts, and
back— appearing after pregnancy, puberty, sudden weight changes, or
heavy workouts.

While harmless, they can affect self-confidence especially when wearing
sleeveless clothes, swimwear, or fitted outfits.

At The Skin Firm, Pune, we offer advanced stretch marks removal
treatments that safely reduce their appearance, restore smoother skin,
and help you feel confident again.

**FAQs** **on** **Stretch** **Marks** **Removal** **in** **Pune**

**1.** **Can** **stretch** **marks** **be** **completely** **removed**?

reduce visibility by stimulating collagen repair.

**stretch** **marks?**

It depends, lasers and microneedling work best for older marks, while
PRP and peels are great for newer ones.

**3.** **How** **many** **sessions** **will** **I** **need?**

> Usually 4-8 sessions, spaced 3-4 weeks apart, depending on the
> severity of your marks.

**4.** **Are** **the** **stretch** **marks** **removal** **treatments**
