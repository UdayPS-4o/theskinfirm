**What is Postnatal Hair Loss?**

**Postnatal (postpartum) hair loss** - often called **postpartum shedding** - is a common concern for many new mothers. The sudden hair thinning or reduced volume occurs due to hormonal shifts after childbirth. While usually temporary, it can be distressing without the right care.

At The Skin Firm, we offer **new mothers hair loss treatment**, combining medical expertise with safe, lactation-friendly solutions. Our treatments, from **postnatal hair fall solutions** to advanced **hair regrowth after pregnancy**, are designed to be gentle, effective, and customised.

With the guidance of a trusted **dermatologist for postnatal hair loss**, we focus on restoring scalp health, improving follicle strength, and encouraging natural regrowth.

**Signs & Concerns Postnatal Hair Loss Treatment Can Treat**

- Sudden increase in hair shedding (large clumps when brushing/washing)
- Noticeably thinner hair or reduced ponytail volume
- Patchy or uneven regrowth after childbirth
- Weak, brittle, or lifeless hair post-delivery
- Scalp sensitivity or poor scalp circulation affecting follicle recovery
- Hair texture changes following pregnancy or breastfeeding

Our dermatologist-led team creates personalised **Postnatal Hair Loss Treatment** plans tailored to your scalp condition, lifestyle, and recovery stage, ensuring the best results.

Using advanced, non-invasive solutions like mesotherapy and growth factor therapy, we stimulate natural hair regrowth without harsh chemicals or downtime.

**How our Postnatal Hair Loss Treatment Works**

**Step 1 - Consultation & Scalp/Hormonal Assessment**  
We evaluate hair loss pattern, postpartum timeline, diet, iron/vitamin status and any medical factors.

Choose safe, effective options suited to breastfeeding mothers: nutrition, topical serums, PRP/GFC (where appropriate), LLLT and gentle mesotherapy.

**Step 3 - The Procedure**  
Treatments are delivered gently - microinjections or topical protocols - focused on nourishing follicles, improving circulation and encouraging regrowth. Sessions are brief and comfortable.

**Step 4 - Aftercare & Follow-up**  
We give simple home-care instructions, nutritional guidance and scheduled follow-ups to track progress and tweak the plan for best results.
