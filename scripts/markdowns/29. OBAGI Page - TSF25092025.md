**What Is OBAGI Facial?**

The OBAGI Facial is a dermatologist-developed skin treatment that uses Obagi® professional-grade products to deliver visible and lasting results. Unlike salon facials that only work on the skin’s surface, this treatment penetrates deeper layers to improve:

- Fine lines and early ageing signs
- Hyperpigmentation and melasma
- Oily or acne-prone skin
- Dehydration and loss of radiance

The Skin Firm offers customised OBAGI facials designed to target your unique skin needs, whether you’re seeking brightening, anti-ageing, or hydration.
