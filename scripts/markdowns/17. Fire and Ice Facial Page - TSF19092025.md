**What** **Is** **a** **Fire** **&** **Ice** **Facial?**

Known worldwide as the **Hollywood** **Red** **Carpet** **Facial**, the
**Fire** **&** **Ice** **Facial** **in** **Pune** is a medical-grade
treatment designed to instantly resurface the skin, reduce fine lines,
clear blemishes and deliver a radiant glow all with zero downtime.

This two-step treatment uses a combination of an intensive resurfacing
mask (the Fire) and a cooling, rejuvenating mask (the Ice). Together,
they safely exfoliate, hydrate, and refresh the skin, making it the
go-to facial for celebrities before big events.

At **The** **Skin** **Firm,** **NIBM,** **Pune,** we bring this
luxurious yet medically effective treatment to you, tailored to your
skin’s needs for maximum results.
