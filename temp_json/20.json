      "title": "What Is a PRP (Vampire) Facial?",
      "content": "The PRP Facial, popularly called the Vampire Facial, is a revolutionary anti-ageing PRP Facial in Pune that uses the healing power of your own blood.\n\nA small sample of your blood is drawn, processed in a centrifuge to extract platelet-rich plasma (PRP) - a golden fluid packed with growth factors. When applied or injected, PRP stimulates collagen and elastin production, repairs scars, and enhances hydration and glow.\n\nUnlike chemical facials, the PRP treatment for skin rejuvenation is 100% natural and safe for all skin types. At The Skin Firm, NIBM, Pune we provide medical-grade PRP microneedling and customised treatments for long-lasting results."
