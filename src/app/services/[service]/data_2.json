One of the most common forms is melasma, which typically appears as brown or grey-brown patches on the face, especially the cheeks, forehead, nose, or upper lip. While pigmentation and melasma are not harmful, they can deeply affect confidence and make skin look uneven or aged.

      "content": "Open pores are enlarged skin openings that often appear on the cheeks, nose, forehead and chin. They occur when oil glands and hair follicles become overactive, leading to visible pores that affect skin smoothness. Factors such as excess oil production, ageing, sun damage, genetics, and acne can worsen pore visibility. While they are harmless, open pores can make the skin look dull, textured, and uneven. At The Skin Firm, Pune, we offer advanced open pores treatments in Hadapsar, Kondhwa, and Wanowrie that tighten skin, reduce pore size, and restore a smoother, more refined complexion."
