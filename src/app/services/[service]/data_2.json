One of the most common forms is melasma, which typically appears as brown or grey-brown patches on the face, especially the cheeks, forehead, nose, or upper lip.

They occur when oil glands and hair follicles become overactive, leading to visible pores that affect skin smoothness. Factors such as excess oil production, ageing, sun damage, genetics, and acne can worsen pore visibility. While they are harmless, open pores can make the skin look dull, textured, and uneven. At The Skin Firm, Pune, we offer advanced open pores treatments in Hadapsar, Kondhwa, and Wanowrie that tighten skin, reduce pore size, and restore a smoother, more refined complexion."

They often start off as red, purple or pink lines and later fade into white or silvery marks. They are commonly found on the abdomen, thighs, hips, arms, breasts, and back—appearing after pregnancy, puberty, sudden weight changes, or heavy workouts. While harmless, they can affect self-confidence especially when wearing sleeveless clothes, swimwear, or fitted outfits.
