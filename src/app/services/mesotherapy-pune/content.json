    "title": "What Is Mesotherapy Treatment?",
    "content": "Mesotherapy is a minimally invasive treatment that involves micro-injections of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other nutrients directly into the mesoderm (middle layer of skin). This targeted delivery system allows for precise treatment of specific areas with customized nutrient cocktails.\n\nOriginally developed in France, mesotherapy is used for both skin rejuvenation and hair restoration. For skin, it improves hydration, elasticity, and overall appearance. For hair, it stimulates follicles and improves scalp health to promote hair growth.\n\nAt The Skin Firm, our mesotherapy treatments are customized by Dr. Karishma Singh based on your specific skin or hair concerns, using pharmaceutical-grade ingredients for optimal safety and effectiveness."
