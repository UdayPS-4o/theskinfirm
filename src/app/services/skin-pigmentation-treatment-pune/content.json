    "title": "What Is Skin Pigmentation (Melasma)?",
    "content": "Often seen as dark patches or uneven tone skin pigmentation occurs when the skin produces excess melanin. One of the most common forms is melasma, which typically appears as brown or grey-brown patches on the face, especially the cheeks, forehead, nose, or upper lip. While pigmentation and melasma are not harmful, they can deeply affect confidence and make skin look uneven or aged.\n\nAt The Skin Firm, we specialise in advanced pigmentation and melasma treatments that go beyond covering up the patches we target the root causes to restore clear, even-toned, radiant skin."
