    "title": "What Is Liposuction Treatment?",
    "content": "Liposuction is a cosmetic surgical procedure that removes excess fat deposits from specific areas of the body to improve body contours and proportions. It's designed to target stubborn fat that doesn't respond to diet and exercise, helping you achieve a more sculpted appearance.\n\nModern liposuction techniques use small cannulas (thin tubes) to suction out fat through tiny incisions, minimizing scarring and recovery time. Common treatment areas include abdomen, thighs, arms, back, and chin.\n\nAt The Skin Firm, our liposuction procedures are performed by Dr. Karishma Singh using advanced techniques that prioritize safety, precision, and natural-looking results. We focus on body contouring rather than weight loss, helping you achieve the shape you desire."

      {
        "question": "How long do liposuction results last?",

        "question": "What is the recovery time for liposuction?",
        "answer": "Most patients return to work in 1-2 weeks and resume normal activities in 4-6 weeks. Complete healing and final results are visible in 3-6 months."
