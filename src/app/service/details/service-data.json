    "description": "At The Skin Firm, our Acne Treatment is designed by a dermatologist's protocol that targets acne at its root and not just the surface. Whether you're dealing with active breakouts, hormonal acne, or persistent post-acne marks, this treatment is tailored to your skin's unique condition. Combining clinical-grade technology with medical-grade formulations, our approach reduces inflammation, clears clogged pores, balances oil production, and prevents future flare-ups, all while being gentle on the skin barrier.",
    "highlight": "Our acne solutions are ideal for everyone, be it teens, adults, or even those with sensitive or acne-prone skin who haven't found success with over-the-counter products.",
