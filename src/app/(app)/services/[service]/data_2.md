Expert dermatologist-led care for dark patches, uneven tone & stubborn pigmentation

**CTA:** Book Your Skin Pigmentation Consultation Today ‚Üí

**What Is Skin Pigmentation (Melasma)?**

Often seen as dark patches or uneven tone skin pigmentation occurs when the skin
produces excess melanin. One of the most common forms is melasma, which typically
appears as brown or grey-brown patches on the face, especially the cheeks, forehead, nose,
or upper lip. While pigmentation and melasma are not harmful, they can deeply affect
confidence and make skin look uneven or aged.

At The Skin Firm, we specialise in advanced pigmentation and melasma treatments that go
beyond covering up the patches we target the root causes to restore clear, even-toned,
radiant skin.

**Signs & Symptoms of Pigmentation & Melasma**

```
ÓÑ¨ Brown, grey, or tan patches on the face
ÓÑ¨ Uneven skin tone or blotchy appearance
ÓÑ¨ Dark spots after sun exposure
ÓÑ¨ Pigmentation on cheeks, forehead, or upper lip
ÓÑ¨ Stubborn marks that worsen with heat or hormones
ÓÑ¨ Skin that looks aged or dull due to uneven tone
```
**Why Choose Pigmentation & Melasma Treatment at The Skin Firm?**

Have dark patches or uneven tone left you hiding behind makeup or filters? We understand
how frustrating it is when your skin no longer feels like yours.

At The Skin Firm, our pigmentation and melasma treatments are designed to treat the root
cause whether it‚Äôs sun damage, hormones, inflammation, or genetics so you can enjoy
brighter, even-toned skin again.

energy, and overall vitality, leaving you feeling refreshed and glowing from the inside out.

during which vitamins and antioxidants flow directly into your bloodstream.

**What Is Tan Removal?**

Sun exposure, heat and pollution often leave the skin looking darker, patchy or uneven, a
condition commonly called tanning. While sunscreen and home remedies can help prevent tan,
once it sets deep into the skin, it becomes stubborn and difficult to fade.

**How Our Tan Removal Treatment Works**

**Step 1 - Consultation & Skin Analysis**

**Step 2 - Personalised Treatment Plan**
Depending on your skin, we may recommend peels, medi facials, or laser treatments for tan
removal.

**Step 3 - Advanced Procedure**
Treatments may include gentle exfoliation, pigmentation-targeting peels, or light-based
therapies that reduce melanin build-up and restore even tone.

**Step 4 - Aftercare & Maintenance**
We provide skincare guidance, sun protection advice, and follow-up plans to prevent future
tanning.

**FAQs on Open Pores Treatment in Pune**

**1. Can open pores be permanently closed?**
    No, pores are natural openings. But with advanced treatments, they can be significantly
minimised to make skin look smoother.


**2. How soon will I see results?**
    Most patients notice improved texture and smaller-looking pores within 2‚Äì3 weeks after **laser
or chemical peel treatment in Pune** , with best results after multiple sessions.
**3. Which treatment works best for open pores?**
    It depends on your skin. Chemical peels, lasers, and microneedling are highly effective and
often combined for better results.
**4. Do creams and home remedies work for open pores?**
    They may temporarily improve skin texture but do not shrink pores significantly. Professional
**dermatologist-led treatments in Pune** give lasting results.
**5. Is the open pores treatment painful?**
    Most treatments are comfortable. You may feel mild tingling or warmth, but numbing and
cooling make sessions tolerable.
**6. How many sessions will I need?**
    Typically 3‚Äì6 sessions spaced a few weeks apart, depending on severity.
**7. Are open pore treatments safe for sensitive skin?**
    Yes, our skin specialist customises each treatment to your skin type to ensure safety.
**8. Will open pore treatment results last forever?**
    Results are long-lasting, but maintenance and good skincare are important to prevent pores
from enlarging again.

Specialist Dr. Karishma Singh.

**CTA** : Book Your Wrinkle Treatment Consultation Today ‚Üí

**What Is Wrinkle Treatment?**

Wrinkles are one of the earliest and most visible signs of ageing. They occur as skin loses
collagen and elasticity, and are often worsened by sun exposure, stress, facial expressions, and
lifestyle habits.

While wrinkles are a natural part of ageing, modern skin treatments can smoothen fine lines,
soften deeper wrinkles, and restore youthful skin without surgery.

At The Skin Firm, our **wrinkle removal treatments in Pune** include **Botox, fillers, PRP,
mesotherapy, and laser wrinkle treatment** to smoothen fine lines, soften deeper wrinkles, and
restore youthful radiance - without surgery.

**Signs & Types of Wrinkles We Treat**

```
ÓÑ¨ Fine lines around the eyes (crow‚Äôs feet)
```
```
ÓÑ¨ Forehead lines and frown lines
ÓÑ¨ Laugh lines around the mouth (nasolabial folds)
```
```
ÓÑ¨ Wrinkles caused by sun damage or smoking

**What Are Stretch Marks?**

Stretch marks, medically known as striae, are long, narrow streaks that develop when the skin
stretches too quickly and the collagen and elastin fibers beneath the surface tear. They often
start off as red, purple or pink lines and later fade into white or silvery marks.

They are commonly found on the abdomen, thighs, hips, arms, breasts, and back‚Äîappearing
after pregnancy, puberty, sudden weight changes, or heavy workouts.

While harmless, they can affect self-confidence especially when wearing sleeveless clothes,
swimwear, or fitted outfits.

At The Skin Firm, Pune, we offer advanced stretch marks removal treatments that safely reduce
their appearance, restore smoother skin, and help you feel confident again.

**Signs & Concerns of Stretch Marks**

```
ÓÑ¨ Red, purple, or pink fresh stretch marks (newer, more active marks)
ÓÑ¨ White or silvery stretch marks (older, settled marks)
```
```
ÓÑ¨ Indented streaks on the skin, especially abdomen, thighs, and arms
```
```
ÓÑ¨ Post-pregnancy stretch marks (postpartum marks)
ÓÑ¨ Marks caused by rapid weight gain or loss
```
```
ÓÑ¨ Reduced skin elasticity in affected areas
```
```
ÓÑ¨ Self-consciousness in clothing choices due to visible marks
```

**Why Choose Stretch Marks Removal at The Skin Firm?**

Stretch marks are extremely common, but when they make you feel uncomfortable in your own
skin, it‚Äôs time to seek treatment. Many people try creams and oils, only to be disappointed with
little to no improvement.

At The Skin Firm, our **dermatologist-supervised stretch marks treatments in Pune** are:

```
ÓÑ¨ Dermatologist-supervised ‚Äì performed under the expert care of Skin Specialist Dr.
Karishma Singh
```
```

**What Is Wart Removal?**

Warts are small, rough, skin-colored or brown growths caused by the human papillomavirus
(HPV). They commonly appear on the hands, feet, face, neck, and even intimate areas.
Although harmless in most cases, warts are contagious and can spread to other parts of the
body or to others through direct contact.

They can also cause discomfort, embarrassment, and self-consciousness especially when they
occur on visible areas like the face, hands or legs.
