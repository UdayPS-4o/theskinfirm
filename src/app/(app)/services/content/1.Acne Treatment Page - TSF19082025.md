**What** **Is** **Acne?**

Acne is a common skin condition that occurs when hair follicles get
clogged with oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria. This leads to pimples,
blackheads, whiteheads, or deeper, painful bumps that may cause scarring
or pigmentation if left untreated.

**Signs** **&** **Symptoms** **of** **Acne**

> Whiteheads (closed clogged pores)
>
> Blackheads (open clogged pores)
>
> Small red, tender bumps (papules)
>
> Pimples with pus (pustules)
>
> Large, painful lumps under the skin (nodules)
>
> Cystic lesions filled with pus (cysts)
>
> Oily skin and shiny appearance
>
> Redness, swelling, or inflammation
>
> Dark spots or scars after breakouts
