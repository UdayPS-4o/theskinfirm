**What** **Is** **a** **PRP** **(Vampire)** **Facial?**

The **PRP** **Facial**, popularly called the **Vampire** **Facial**, is
a revolutionary **anti-ageing** **PRP** **Facial** **in** **Pune** that
uses the healing power of your own blood.

A small sample of your blood is drawn, processed in a centrifuge to
extract **platelet-rich** **plasma** **(PRP)** - a golden fluid packed
with growth factors. When applied or injected, PRP stimulates collagen
and elastin production, repairs scars, and enhances hydration and glow.

Unlike chemical facials, the **PRP** **treatment** **for** **skin**
**rejuvenation** is 100% natural and safe for all skin types. At **The**
**Skin** **Firm,** **NIBM**, **Pune** we provide **medical-grade**
**PRP** **microneedling** and customised treatments for long-lasting
results.

**FAQs** **on** **PRP** **Facial**

**1.** **What** **is** **the** **difference** **between** **a** **PRP**

They are the same treatment. PRP Facial is the medical term, while
Vampire Facial is its popular name.

rejection. At **The** **Skin** **Firm,** **Pune**, our **PRP** **for**
**skin** **rejuvenation** is performed under dermatologist supervision,
ensuring complete safety.

**3.** **Does** **the** **PRP** **Facial** **hurt?**

mild tingling during **PRP** **microneedling** or injections.

**the** **PRP** **Facial?**

give the best results for acne scars, anti-ageing, and under-eye
rejuvenation.

**5.** **When** **will** **I** **see** **results** **from** **my**
**PRP** **Facial?**

A healthy glow appears within a week. Collagen stimulation from the
**PRP** **anti-ageing** **facial** continues to improve skin texture and
elasticity over 2–4 weeks.

**6.** **How** **long** **do** **results** **last** **from** **my**
**PRP** **Facial?**

Results from the **PRP** **Facial** typically last 12–18 months,
depending on lifestyle, skincare routine, and maintenance sessions.

**7.** **Can** **PRP** **Facial** **help** **with** **acne** **scars?**

Yes - **PRP** **treatment** **for** **acne** **scars** is one of the
most effective ways to reduce marks, refine skin texture, and promote
natural healing.

**8.** **Does** **PRP** **Facial** **work** **for** **dark**
**circles?**

Absolutely. **PRP** **for** **under-eye** **dark** **circles** helps
improve pigmentation, fine lines, and hollows, making the eyes look
brighter and well-rested.

**9.** **Is** **there** **a** **downtime** **after** **PRP** **facial?**

swelling from the **PRP** **Vampire** **Facial** fades in 1-2 days.
