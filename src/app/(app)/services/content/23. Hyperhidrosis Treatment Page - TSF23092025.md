**What** **Is** **Hyperhidrosis?**

Hyperhidrosis is a medical condition where the body produces excessive
sweat beyond what’s needed to regulate temperature. It can affect
specific areas like the underarms, palms, soles, or face, or occur
across the body.

While sweating is natural, **excessive** **sweating** **in** **Pune’s**
**climate** can be uncomfortable, embarrassing, and disruptive - making
handshakes, public speaking, or even wearing light-colored clothes
stressful.

At The Skin Firm, we offer safe, advanced, and dermatologist-supervised
**hyperhidrosis** **treatment** **in** **Pune** to reduce sweating,
restore comfort, and boost confidence in daily life.

**Signs** **&** **Symptoms** **of** **Hyperhidrosis**

>

>
