**What** **Is** **GFC** **Therapy?**

GFC Therapy (Growth Factor Concentrate Therapy) is an advanced,
autologous (your own blood-derived) treatment that harnesses the power
of natural growth factors to stimulate healing, regeneration, and
rejuvenation.

A small amount of your blood is processed in a special kit to extract a
highly concentrated solution of platelet-derived growth factors. These
growth factors are then injected into the scalp (for hair regrowth) or
skin (for scars, wrinkles, or dullness).

Compared to traditional PRP, **GFC** **Therapy** **in** **Pune** is more
refined, more concentrated, and delivers better, faster results - with
minimal discomfort and zero risk of allergies.

At The Skin Firm, Pune, we offer GFC Therapy for both hair restoration
and skin rejuvenation, using advanced kits under dermatologist
supervision.

> We evaluate your scalp or skin concerns to design a personalised plan.

**Step** **2** **-** **Blood** **Collection** **&** **Processing**

A small amount of blood is collected and processed in a specialised kit
