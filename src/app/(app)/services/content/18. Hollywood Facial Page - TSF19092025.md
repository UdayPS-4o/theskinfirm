**How** **Our** **Hollywood** **Facial** **Works**

**Step** **1** **–** **Consultation** **&** **Skin** **Prep**

Your skin is cleansed and assessed to ensure the treatment is customised
to your concerns.

**Step** **2** **–** **Carbon** **Application**

A thin layer of medical-grade carbon lotion is applied to the skin,
which penetrates deep into pores and absorbs impurities.

**Step** **3** **–** **Laser** **Treatment**

A laser passes over the skin, destroying the carbon particles. This
process gently exfoliates, unclogs pores, and stimulates collagen.

**Step** **4** **–** **Cooling** **&** **Hydration**

Soothing serums and hydrating masks are applied to restore balance,
leaving your skin fresh and glowing.
