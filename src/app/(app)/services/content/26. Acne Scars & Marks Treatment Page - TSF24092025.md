**What** **Are** **Acne** **Scars** **&** **Marks?**

Even after acne heals, many people are left with scars and marks that
can linger for years.

> Acne Scars - Permanent changes in skin texture such as pits,
> depressions, or raised areas caused by deep acne inflammation.
>
> Acne Marks (Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation) - Dark spots or
> reddish-brown patches left behind after pimples heal.

Both can affect your skin’s smoothness and your confidence but with the
right treatment, they can be effectively reduced.

**Signs** **&** **Types** **of** **Acne** **Scars/Marks**

> Flat brown/black spots after pimples (marks)
>
> Depressed or pitted scars (ice-pick, boxcar, rolling)
>
> Raised or thickened scars (hypertrophic/keloid)
>
> Uneven skin tone and texture
>
> Dull, patchy appearance
>
> Emotional distress or lowered self-esteem

**FAQs** **on** **Acne** **Scars** **&** **Marks** **Treatment** **in**
**Pune**

**1.** **Can** **acne** **scars** **be** **completely** **removed?**

Most scars can be significantly improved, though very deep scars may not
vanish 100%. Treatments smoothen and lighten them greatly.

**results?**

Usually 3-6 sessions, depending on scar severity and treatment type.

**3.** **Is** **acne** **scar** **treatment** **painful?**

Most treatments are well-tolerated. Numbing cream is used to keep you
comfortable.

Improvements begin after 2–3 sessions, with continued results over
months.

Yes, all our procedures at The Skin Firm are customised and safe for
Indian skin tones.

**6.** **Do** **acne** **marks** **(dark** **spots)** **fade** **on**
**their** **own?**

Mild marks may fade with time, but deeper pigmentation often needs
treatment.

**7.** **Which** **treatment** **is** **best** **for** **pitted**
**scars?**

Microneedling RF and fractional lasers work best for deep scars.

**8.** **Is** **there** **downtime** **after** **treatment?**

Minimal to moderate, depending on the procedure. Most people return to
work the next day.

confidence.
