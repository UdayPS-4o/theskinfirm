    "title": "What Is PRP Treatment?",
    "content": "PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma) treatment is a revolutionary regenerative therapy that uses your own blood platelets to stimulate natural healing and rejuvenation. The treatment involves extracting a small amount of your blood, processing it to concentrate the platelets, and then injecting or applying this platelet-rich plasma to target areas.\n\nPRP is rich in growth factors and proteins that promote tissue repair, collagen production, and cellular regeneration. It's used for both skin rejuvenation (often called the 'vampire facial') and hair restoration, offering natural results without synthetic substances.\n\nAt The Skin Firm, our PRP treatments are performed by Dr. Karishma Singh using advanced processing techniques to ensure maximum platelet concentration and optimal results for both facial rejuvenation and hair restoration."
