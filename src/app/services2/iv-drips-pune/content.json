    "content": "IV drip therapy is a revolutionary wellness treatment that delivers essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients directly into your bloodstream for maximum absorption and immediate benefits.\n\nUnlike oral supplements that lose potency through digestion, IV therapy ensures 100% bioavailability, meaning your body receives the full therapeutic dose of nutrients it needs to function optimally.\n\nAt The Skin Firm, our IV drip therapy sessions are designed to boost immunity, increase energy levels, enhance skin radiance, support weight management, and promote overall wellness. Under the expert supervision of Dr. Karishma Singh, each IV drip is customized to your specific health goals and needs."
