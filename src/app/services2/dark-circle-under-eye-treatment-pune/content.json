    "title": "What Are Dark Circles & Under Eye Concerns?",
    "content": "Dark circles are one of the most common cosmetic concerns, giving the face a tired, dull, or prematurely aged look. They may appear as pigmentation, hollowness, puffiness, or fine lines under the eyes. While lack of sleep is often blamed, the real causes are usually deeper - ranging from genetics and ageing to thinning skin, poor circulation, allergies, or stress. Under eye concerns not only affect appearance but also self-confidence.\n\nAt The Skin Firm, NIBM, Pune we specialise in dark circle removal in Pune with advanced dermatologist-led treatments. Our under-eye treatment in Pune is designed to address the root cause, leaving you with brighter, smoother, and refreshed-looking eyes."
