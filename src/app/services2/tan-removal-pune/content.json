    "title": "What Is Tan Removal Treatment?",
    "content": "Tan removal treatment is a specialized dermatological procedure designed to reduce sun damage, remove stubborn tan lines, and restore your skin's natural, even tone. Sun exposure causes melanin production that leads to darkening and uneven pigmentation.\n\nWhether you have tan lines from vacation, sports activities, or daily sun exposure, professional tan removal treatments can help fade the darkening and reveal brighter, more uniform skin underneath.\n\nAt The Skin Firm, our tan removal treatments combine advanced techniques with medical-grade products to safely and effectively reduce sun damage. Under the expert care of Dr. Karishma Singh, we customize each treatment to your skin type and specific tanning concerns."
